# README

[Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) is publishing patched versions of the [M+ font](https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/) including powerline and other useful glyphs.

They even publish each font, including mplus, as a [homebrew cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts/blob/master/Casks/font-mplus-nerd-font.rb) but unfortunately, the package installs all font variants with the same name, resulting in conflicts for the font manager.

This repository serves up only [M+ mn](https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/design.html#mplus_mn1) with Mono Nerd Font Glyphs.
